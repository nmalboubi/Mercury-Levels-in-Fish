# Mercury-Levels-in-Fish
The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has monitored the levels of mercury in largemouth bass 
in the local waterways.
They have sampled fish from two different rivers, of which we will call River0 and River1. In
addition, these rivers were further divided up into 16 locations, known as “Stations”, and 
fish from each station were sampled and analyzed. 

In this study, we will model a relationship between mercury 
found in the fish given their station location, their length, weight, andwhether or not they are deemed safe to eat.
